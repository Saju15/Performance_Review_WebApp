The feedback 2 below was received for our 'Component Architecture Document' group submission. We have outlined how our 
Sprint 3 efforts would have differed if this feedback had been provided earlier in the sprint.

### Component Architecture Document (15 %)
- 3/5 points Details of components and interfaces in document
    - You are responsible for describing interaction with major components you did not write, eg. beaker and bottle-session
      - There is no prose! Diagrams alone will not be sufficient to understand what's going on

- 3/5 points Use of diagramming and prose to concisely offer complete details
    - beaker, etc missing
    - Including private implementation details instead of concisely representing interface elements is not the depiction 
  I directed you to use.
  
- 3/5 points Consistent with modules, interfaces, docstring and unit tests
  - unit tests?

###  _Hypothetical Architecture Documents for Sprint 3:_ 

1. Complete Component Inclusion: We would have included all components such as beaker and bottle-session in our architecture 
diagrams, ensuring a complete overview.

2. Prose Explanation: Our document would have contained clear prose explaining the interaction of components, supplementing 
the diagrams for better understanding.

3. Focus on Interfaces: We would have focused on representing interface elements as directed, avoiding private implementation 
details.

4. Unit Test Details: The document would have included references to unit tests, as we would have clarified this expectation 
with the professor.
