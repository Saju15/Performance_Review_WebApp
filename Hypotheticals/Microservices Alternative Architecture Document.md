### Hypothetical Microservices Document 
(The actual documents can be found in the Architecture Diagrams folder)
If we had received feedback from our professor, we would have taken these steps:

1. We would have shown our two microservices architecture diagrams to the professor. 
Based on his feedback, we would have made sure that we correctly identified all possible microservices and that they fit
well with our project's goals.

2. We would have used the professor's insights to strengthen our comparison between the proposed microservices architecture 
and our current component-based architecture. 

3. The professor's feedback would have been helpful in understanding how switching to a microservices architecture might 
change our team's software development process. We would have discussed and adjusted our workflow, testing, and team 
coordination plans accordingly.
