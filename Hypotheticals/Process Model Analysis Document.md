The feedback 2 below was received for our 'Process Model Analysis Document' group submission. We have outlined how our 
Sprint 3 efforts would have differed if this feedback had been provided earlier in the sprint.

### Process Model Analysis Document (15 %)
- 4/5 points Elements of process identified and explained. Distinction made between process and process model.
    - I expected some reflection on the difference between the model and reality.
- 5/5 points Changes in process since beginning of project are discussed.
  - This was a bit thin, and I also failed to see the more robust code review mechanism results, where you lost marks above.
- 4/5 points Ideas for improving process in future and what will team do about it.
  - More expected. E.g. what can be thrown out of the process, what is imposed by the professor, etc.

###  _Hypothetical Process Model Analysis Document for Sprint 3:_ 
1. Model vs. Reality Analysis: We would include a section comparing our process model with actual practices, highlighting key differences and learnings.

2. Detailed Process Changes: Our document would offer a deeper look into how our process has evolved, especially focusing on the impact of our improved code review methods.

3. Future Improvement Ideas: We would expand our suggestions for future process improvements, identifying what could be removed or altered, and noting any requirements set by the professor.
