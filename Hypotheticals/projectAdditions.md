## Individual and Other Team Additions after Sprint 2 Feedback

## Team Additions
Hypothetically team submission for sprint 3 would also have had the following,
 - Ensured all methods and classes have appropriate docstrings
 - More unit tests to test the modules.
 - Our kanban board has more appropriate labels. (We would have liked to discuss this
with the professor as we were already labelling our issues but seems like it's not what expected)
 - Check our performance reviews are critical where needed
 - Add more details into our issues and make sure all are documented
 - Add to our README and meeting notes that we only pushed to master after it was decided it
    was appropriate as a group, all pushes to master (besides accidental pushes in the start
    of project) were approved by group members.
 - Add more details into our kan ban for features we would like to have implemented but did not,
    ex. how we would begin to implement them or if it is a feature we no longer want to create.

## Individual Additions

### Hailey
 - Check to see where I was losing points for doc strings, as most of my contribution was in the 
    front-end which does not require docstrings generally.
 - Talk with prof for which aspects of the code I was responsible for were not working or attributed
    properly

One hypothetical improvement I would like to have made is more specific requirements for what a valid password can be upon registration, and upon editing the password. Ideally, the password registration or modification process would require that specific parameters are met in terms of length and symbols allowed to be used.

An additional hypothetical improvement I would have liked to make is the requirement for a certain amount of time to have passed before user information can be changed again, although I am unsure of the implementation details of this issue.

A final detail of implementation that I would have hypothetically liked to include is the inability to reuse a previously used password, when changing password in the edit user portion of the project.

Some hypothetical improvements I could have made as a team member were being more involved in the code review processes as, better documentation of my own code, familiarity with other aspects of the project aside from what I worked on, and ideally I would like to learn more about the HTML and CSS side of the project if we had more time to work on the project.

Hypothetically my individual submission would have had the following,
- Attributions added in a more timely manner, rather than added at the end of sprint.
- Coding components are adhered to the standards, and also ensuring updating docstrings when methods are updated.
- Described details of my architecture component(Storage) in the UML diagram.
- Code reviews of my code are helpful and have lead to backlog items if appropriate.
