The feedback 2 below was received for our 'Code Review' group submission. We have outlined how our 
Sprint 3 efforts would have differed if this feedback had been provided earlier in the sprint.

### Code reviews conducted and documented. (20 %)
Code should be regularly presented and discussed at SCRUM meetings, not just at end of cycle.
- 3/3 points Code contributions are presented to entire team.
- 2/10 points Code reviews are thorough, covering style issues (SOLID, de-coupling) as well as correctness.
  - I can;t evaluate this, as you mention code reviews in your notes, but I am unable to find out comes or suggestions from the code reviews. Am I missing them?
- 3/5 points All code should be reviewed before pull request is merged.
  - THis appears to be the case, but I am unable to see any verification. Also, non-code elements are pushed onto master directly. Was this decided at any time?
- 1/2 points Pull request deadlines established and enforced.
  - Code merges after the 9th.

### Hypothetical Code Review for Sprint 3:
1. Documentation of Code Reviews: We would ensure that all code reviews are thoroughly documented, both in our meeting notes 
and within the comments of our pull requests. This would make it easier to track the outcomes and suggestions from these reviews.

2. Focus on Thorough Reviews: Our code reviews would be more comprehensive, covering not only correctness but also style 
issues. We would create a structured template or checklist to ensure all aspects are covered.

3. Verification of Reviewed Code: To address the concern of verification, we would implement a system where each pull request 
must have documented approval from a code review before merging. This would include a log of who reviewed the code and a summary of their findings.
