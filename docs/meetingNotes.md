In today's meeting, we decided who will be the SCRUM master. The group voted and decided Hailey is a good fit.
We also began brainstorming what our project will be. Some of our ideas are
* Recipe website
* Weather app
* Snowrunner tm truck dictionary
* e-commerce site
* budget app

The source control strategy we are using is trunk based.

Our branches are going to be our group member's first names so it is easy to keep track of everyone's progress .

Our tentative final push date is October 17th.

Today we decided on what our project will be. We are going to make an encyclopedia for the game SnowRunner. This is a 
truck driving based game. We plan to make a webapp to find information about the different trucks / maps
and maybe a forum / social media feature. 

We started using our KanBan as the main way to organize our tasks, and added columns for each group member to try and
minimize confusion for what is expected from each person. We also created a chart using Lucid.app for our project 
structure to keep files and folders organized. 

The final date for our pull requests is still planned for October 17th, and our code and performance review push date 
is TBD

This meeting was to try and iron out some confusion about the project
and what was actually expected of us. We originally thought the project
could be anything we wanted and had begun planning a project that was not 
similar to the project we were actually expected to make.

After re-reading project instructions and discussing with the group we reallocated 
tasks to each group member and worked on our UML diagram, as well as stubs for classes/methods
inline with actual project expectations.

We plan on meeting again in a few days to further make sure everyone is on the same page
after the change in plans.

Last day of sprint 1. 

As we did not do code reviews during team meetings throughout this sprint, we decided to do overall code review for 
Sprint1 today. 

We also merged final pull-requests from team members. 

We reflected on sprint 1, walking through our development process. Even though our team members were assigned to
specific web framework component at the beginning of the sprint, we ended up sharing the coding tasks. We are going to
aim to be more strict on following our assigned roles for the next sprint.

Moving forward we would like to,
1. Develop proper user personal info page. 
2. Get edit reviews working. 
3. Check if user already exists before signing up, etc.
4. Define coding tasks as early as possible.
5. Improve css to match the UI design.

2. identify tasks still not completed from sprint 1;
3. identify features for 2nd sprint; 
4. decompose features into coding tasks; 
5. try to identify possible interface revisions required for coding tasks

We also discussed the additional two new features each group member would have to complete for sprint 2.
We have begun to delegate tasks to implement the new features.
The features and tasks that we have decided to include thus far include:
1. Make our homepage match the desired layout with the HTML and CSS (task)
2. We want to create a user page using Bottle and HTML (feature) 
3. In the user page, we want view account details (feature), edit account details (feature), view drafts (feature),
   edit drafts (feature), view reviews posted about you (feature), see reviews you have posted about others (feature)
4. In the home page, we want a search feature (feature), we want to sort reviews by various metrics such as time
   (feature), our star rating for average review score (feature), our keyword repository for reviews (feature)

We plan to discuss the implementation details of these features and will begin delegating tasks to complete these 
features in the next class.

**Time:** 1-3pm 
**Attendance:** Patrick, Hailey, Saju (**present online:** Jason, Michael)

In today's meeting we focused on getting aspects on our software process up to date. The code goals we have left are 
minor. We are connecting the front end of the filter reviews function with the backend method through the server, as 
well as some minor css changes for design.

We merged Michael's pull request, and reviewed the code in the comments. There were no major issues to be noted. This 
request was to implement the methods necessary to make the filter functionality work. We also merged Hailey's pull
request with changes to the design (css) of the site. 
We merged Saju's pull request which implement server side for filter feature.

All other methods we were hoping to implement for sprint 2 are going to be backlog features for sprint 3.

We as well changed the readme to reflect where to find material for grading.

Our final date to push any code is today, Nov. 9th 2023, and our final date to finish architecture docs, performance
reviews, and other documentation (including unit tests) is Nov. 10th 2023.

It is also important to note that we were only made aware today that every task in our kanban should be an issue with
tags attached. We implemented this for tasks in our backlog but not anywhere else, so we will begin doing this for 
sprint 3.

changes made to interfaces during sprint 2. 

We walked through our architecture design. Architecture documents are still in progress and will be pushed before midnight.

We created issues for the tasks that are planned for sprint 2 but are not completed (in-progress tab of Kanban)

We reflected on sprint 2, walking through our development process. We also discussed agenda items we missed during previous meetings (this is due to us 
using class time for code reviews and other tasks).

Moving forward we would like to (in Sprint 3),
1. Discuss MVC pattern to help with our architecture
2. Discuss ways to test API with POSTMAN 
3. Star working on design/ other documents early on the sprint. 
4. Implement unit tests for all the methods. (This should be done everytime a new method is implemented)
5. User profile tabs needs to fixed (Issue created)
6. Finish incomplete features (Reviews by me, Reviews about me, Edit drafts)
7. Implement other features from our backlog 
8. Improve our code review method 
9. Reorganize repository

Today, we discussed the grading scheme of Sprint 3. We examined the Kanban backlog in order to determine what features
we could next implement. We have determined that is necessary to implement three additional features. 

We decided to reexamine what we need to complete by looking at the in progress column in the Kanban to see what is 
necessary. Additionally, Hailey made every task in the Kanban (except previously completed tasks) an issue as this was 
what was expected from us initially in the previous grading sprint. 

We have made note of the fact that the final sprint is due on December 4th. We will begin to plan our schedule around
this.

On Monday, we plan to have our individual tasks that were assigned today completed. 

We have determined that when we write a method, we must write a unit test prior to making a pull request.

We have decided to review what we must complete that we have missed from sprint 1 and 2, in order to complete them for
this sprint.

Today, we are assigning the appropriate unittests to who wrote the respective method.

We are beginning to discuss the three additional features:
-Emoji reactions for reviews.
-Reviews sorted by topics (a new homepage will be created to sort the reviews by a specified topic. There will 
additionally be a new method to create topics users can post under).
-Potentially keyword tagging (we are not sure yet as to what our third feature will be).

We have decided that we are going to change the front end such that it displays a list of topics. You can click on the 
topic to see a list of all reviews related to the specified topic. Any new review added will be required to include
a topic.

Tasks:
(To be completed by Monday)
Patrick:
-I will be assigned a task after our meeting tomorrow.

Jason:
-Completing the tabs frontend portion in the user profile page.

Michael:
-Michael will also be assigned a task at our meeting tomorrow.

Hailey:
-Creating the frontend for edit drafts

Saju:
-Consider the design of the interface for the reviews sorted by topic.

### Final Date for all the Pull Requests -> December 7th, 2023

### Important
We discussed/reflected upon our progress for sprint 3, and how the delay in Feedback 2 has
affected our progress.
- We wanted to discuss issues regarding our previous architecture documents as well as get
input about our micro-architecture document which we weren't able to due to the delays.
- We also wanted to see our feedback on performance review to do better in sprint 3.
- We adopted different methodology to maintain our Kanban board, we were expecting to see
feedbacks on that as well.
- We hoped to see feedbacks on our unit tests to see what we have is acceptable or if we need
to do differently.
- We used the class time to conduct code reviews and other discussions, we were unable to assign enough time 
to watch videos or read notes. It would have been more efficient to either have proper lectures or less expectations 
for our group meetings.

**Venue:** Virtual

**Time:** 9-11pm    
**Attendance:**  Patrick, Michael, Hailey, Saju, Jason

#### Code Reviews 
(_Note_: All the code reviews can be found as comments under pull requests)
1. Code reviews were not necessary for a large portion of pull requests today as everyone pushed their performance 
    reviews (except Saju, explained below)
2. Michael pushed changes to the emoji reactions for reviews as well as editing drafts. There were no issues with the
    code itself, but after merging we discovered it caused errors with other aspects of our code that had to be updated.
    Hailey also made a commit to Michael's branch as we decided as a group it was the best solution, as a test review was
    accidentally pushed
3. Jason pushed unit testing for the review module, all code seemed to be working as expected, so we did not review any 
    issues
4. Hailey pushed changes to the front end as well as fixes to some errors that persisted after some methods were changed
    from earlier pushes.

#### New tasks created
1. Look into and create "hypothetical" folder with changes we wanted but could not implement (issue #180)

#### Tasks in-progress
1. Create Hypothetical folder - Hailey and Saju
2. Saju will be pushing her performance reviews tomorrow, as we decided to move our pull request date to tomorrow as
    exam prep has slowed down the schedule we were hoping to keep.
3. Fix issue where author is not being saved

### Final Date for all Pull Requests -> December 8th, 2023

### Outstanding Issues
- Tabs in profile page not working as expected
- When someone edits their account information it is not updated in the front end
- When a user creates a review the author is not being saved (will be fixed tomorrow)

We have decided to meet tomorrow to make sure kanban reflects where the project currently stands, update all documents,
finish all performance reviews, and fix minor errors.

No major code implementation will be pushed, all issues and unimplemented features will be documented.

## December 12th, 2023

**Recorded by:** Hailey Kinsella 

We did not have any more meetings after the last recorded meeting note, as our final exam schedules were very
packed, and we decided we did not have much to discuss in a group meeting regardless. We decided in our team group chat
the best course was to add a note to the end of our meeting notes to tie up some loose ends.

Our new final push date is today, Dec 12th

We merged a pull request from Saju in which she made changes to our hypothetical folder, as well as pull from Hailey
where documents were moved from hypothetical to the architecture folder, and additions to meeting notes.

We decided to go through our in progress tab in the Kanban and add descriptions/comments on how the progress is 
going and optionally discuss what we would have done if we had more time. 

Otherwise, the project will stay in the state it currently is, with all known issues documented in the Kanban and
in-progress tasks being frozen as are.
