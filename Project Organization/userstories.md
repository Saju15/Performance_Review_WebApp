    I, a software engineer went to write a review for one of my teammates, and found that simply writing a paragraph of
    text about my team member was not making the traits I liked and disliked as clear as I wanted. I realized there was
    no option to highlight traits or select keywords that represented the review subject, which I did not appreciate.
    After realizing I could not make my feelings as clear as I wanted, I decided to go comment under a different review 
    about the team member to agree with what they had said, and found this was not a feature either. I could not 
    support my other team members and agree with what they said, nor add keywords to make sure my feelings were clearly 
    conveyed. Overall this review sight is missing a lot of features that would make the review process much better.

    I wanted to sort reviews by date, topic, user, etc. to find the review with the lowest rating, when I found out I 
    could not do this, I lost my mind. It's utterly outrageous that in this day and age, a website wouldn't provide 
    basic sorting features for user reviews. Do they expect me to spend hours sifting through a sea of opinions and 
    comments to find what I want? And the fact that I can't post anonymously got on my nerves. I want to say anything 
    without consequences, when I found out I could not do this, I smashed my computer. Don't they understand the 
    importance of privacy and freedom of expression?

    I am a computer science student and I am using the review website. I was looking at my page and I have plenty of 
    reviews, but I was curious to find my average review rating. I was disappointed to learn that there is no feature 
    currently available to average my scores on my review page. I would like to see my average rating so I can feel 
    better about myself.

    I am a software engineer and I created an account on the review site and unfortunately, I have forgotten both my 
    username and password. To try and remedy this issue, I attempted to reset my username and password. To my dismay, 
    there is no feature currently present to reset my account credentials. I think this is a severe problem and it 
    should be fixed so I can resume my usage of this website.

    As a scrum master of a large team of software engineers, I requested my colleagues to write a 
    comprehensive review on a certain topic. To my surprise some of them missed the deadline and some misunderstood
    the topic of discussion. I think the Review software needs a feature that allows me to schedule a review topic
    so that my team is notified of an approaching deadline. Ensuring that reviews are comprehensive, timely, 
    and that we maintain a consistent publishing.

    I also frequently uses the platform and desires an enhanced experience. For example schedule a topic, 
    update/delete a topic etc. so I prefer to subscribe to a Plus Subscription, so that I can access extra 
    functionalities, ensuring I have the tools to write, edit, and manage my reviews more efficiently.

    As a computer science student, I wanted to voice my opinion about one of my colleagues reviews, and see all the 
    reviews about them in one place. However, I could not find any option to voice my opinion anywhere on this site,
    be it positively or negatively. Therefor I was very disappointed. believe it would be of great improvement for 
    this site to add the possibility to upvote and down vote reviews, and to easily find all the reviews about 
    myself and other users.
