# Performance Reviews

## Sprint 3

**Reviews for Saju**

    Saju has been super helpful this sprint, as she has been throughout this project. We have worked wonderfully 
    together and are often on the same page. Any issues we have Saju easily steps up to help without fail. She spends a 
    lot of time making sure we are meeting the course requirements and always goes above and beyond to take on work. I 
    have enjoyed working with her and would love to work on something again with her in the future. Overall I have no 
    complaints about Saju, and while I know criticism is important, it would be dishonest if I tried to come up with 
    any. - Hailey

    Saju worked really hard this sprint and like usual, she split and organized tasks among the team in a very organized
    and efficient way and made sure everyone would be able to meet the requirements for this sprint. She was always
    available to help and to explain things. Overall, Saju is a crucial member of our team and I am glad to be 
    working with her. - Michael
    
     Saju has shown a lot of grit to push through bugs or problems that take a lot of time. She also has a very broad, 
    all-around skillset from using Gtihub to working on the backend or frontend.  One piece of advice would be to break 
    up the project into smaller chunks rather than trying to deal with the whole thing at once. - Jason

    Saju is a very hard working member of the team. She is incredibly organized and diligent. 
    Communication was always clear, and she is very knowledgeable about Github and the server side of things. 
    She has often helped me with technical issues concerning Github details. It has been very 
    beneficial to work with Saju. - Patrick

**Reviews for Hailey**

    Just like in the previous sprints, Hailey is still hard-working and dedicates a lot of her free time to improve our
    project. She and I were working together on getting emoji reactions to work, me being on the back-end and her on the
    front-end. She implemented my back-end functions to the front-end efficiently and communicated well with me whenever
    she encountered a problem or needed something to be done. - Michael

    Hailey is a detail-oriented and organized teammate. She has fixed numerous bugs by combing through the frontend 
    codebase. She noticed many small problems with the website that no one else noticed. One criticism is that she 
    tends to take on more work than necessary, which can sometimes lead to burnout. - Jason

    Hailey has been a very active member of the group. She and I worked together on the edit_user function with her 
    doing the front-end and myself doing the backend. Communication was always clear. She is a very hard worker, 
    and incredibly organized. Her ability to lead a work-related conversation has been a huge asset for directing the 
    efforts of the group. - Patrick

    I wanted to mention that while we are expected to talk about any issues or conflicts here, I honestly didn't have 
    any with Hailey. So, I just want to give her some well-deserved kudos. Working with Hailey on this project was 
    awesome. She wasn't just on top of her tasks; she was a great leader too. She really knows the project inside and 
    out, and we kept going back to our first feedback and sprint goals to make sure we were on the right track. I really 
    enjoyed seeing her creative side in action and appreciate all the effort she put in to make our project look good. 
    It's definitely a cool addition to our portfolio, thanks to her. - Saju

**Reviews for Michael**
    
    Michael has been wonderful throughout this project and was no different for Sprint 3. He got all assigned tasks done
    on time and always attended group meetings. Michael was a big help in getting the back end completed for many of the
    features I worked to implement in the front end and it was nice not to worry about him getting things finished. 
    Also, when we had any issues with his code he immediately went to implement the changes and was very open to 
    criticism. If I had to give any constructive criticism it would be for Michael to be more confident in his ability 
    to lead and be a SCRUM master, he often asks for help, which is completely fine, but I know that he is very capable 
    of being a great organizer on his own if he is more confident in his ability. - Hailey

    Micheal is a very good team player.  He is always willing to lend a hand to and see if anyone needs any help.
    His positive attitude kept the team’s morale high throughout the whole project. I suggest that he should consider
    being more confident with his decisions rather than second guessing himself too much. - Jason

    Micheal has been very present at our meetings. Communication was always clear, and Micheal often figured out 
    innovative solutions for solving problems on the review side of things. It has been very beneficial to work with 
    Micheal as he often provides insight which widened my perspective concerning certain aspects of my implementation 
    details. - Patrick

    Michael was fantastic in this sprint, just like always. He's reliable, always getting his tasks done on time and 
    he has given us great ideas about how we can implement and organize our features. Working with him is really smooth 
    – no conflicts or anything because he's just so easy-going. My only bit of friendly advice for Michael is to jump 
    into the decision-making process a bit more, even if no one's specifically asking him to. I know this is one of our 
    first big academic projects, so there's definitely room to grow. - Saju

**Reviews for Jason**
    
    Jason has been absent this sprint, which was an issue for sprint 2 as well. While he was present slightly 
    more I still feel he could have put in more effort. Jason did not complete many tasks that were assigned to him this
    sprint and missed meetings. I am happy to see an increase in effort, but it can be challenging at times as he often 
    needs assistance working on tasks which takes up group time. Overall I know Jason can be a really strong member of
    the team, and wish I could have seen more of that from him during this project. - Hailey

    My complaints about Jason from the previous sprints still persist. In this sprint, Jason did a minimal amount of
    work while constantly struggling to complete his tasks and was absent numerous times. Therefore, I wish he had
    put in more time on this course and taken it more seriously. - Michael

    Jason is a very clear communicator. He was generally available to reach online, 
    due to commuting to campus. Due to myself predominantly working on the user class, 
    I did not often have an opportunity to work together on the same thing. 
    Despite this, our discussions of implementation have been beneficial. - Patrick

    I was really looking forward to seeing more engagement from Jason in this sprint, but it seems like we didn't quite 
    get there. He started off well, showing up and working well at the beginning. However, his involvement seemed to 
    decrease as the sprint progressed, picking up again only towards the end. My advice to Jason is to take group work 
    more seriously. I believe we have a supportive and friendly team, so if there were any issues with task assignments 
    or anything, it would have been great to communicate that early on. I do believe Jason has a lot of potential 
    and should consider tapping into that more often, especially in collaborative settings where his contributions can 
    really make a difference. - Saju

**Reviews for Patrick**

    Patrick has been very diligent in getting his work done and taking on extra work if required, I have not had to 
    worry about Patrick missing deadlines or missing meetings, which goes a long way. Sometimes his code can be hard to
    understand, but Patrick will always go through the code with you and explain his reasoning if I had to give any 
    criticism, it would be to try and write clearer code from the start to just save himself and the group time trying 
    to understand it. Overall I have enjoyed my time working with him and am excited to see what he does next. - Hailey

    Patrick takes his tasks seriously and does everything he is assigned to do. He always asks good questions and offers
    to help anyone who is running into problems. He attends every meeting and does not miss any deadlines. However, his
    work can sometimes be unorganized and unclear. - Michael

    Patrick has been vital for problem solving on our team. His unit tests were concise and efficient. He creates 
    innovative solutions and has a constant drive to improve. His cooperation has been essential in moving forward. He 
    maintains clear and concise communication and is often attentive to the project being on schedule. One piece of 
    advice is for him to not lose track of time when working on tasks. - Jason

    Patrick was a fantastic team member throughout the project. He diligently worked on his assigned tasks and was more 
    than willing to take on additional non-coding tasks, which I really appreciated. I've noticed he's been taking more 
    initiative in this sprint as well and is always available when needed. There weren't any major conflicts with Patrick, 
    just a few instances where he didn't update his branch regularly, leading to some errors during merges. But considering 
    this is one of our first major projects, that's totally understandable. Working with Patrick is a pleasure, and I 
    really value his contributions and effort. - Saju

## Sprint 2

**Reviews for Saju**

	Saju has been very diligent and present. She has helped me greatly with any troubleshooting I’ve had to do with 
    organizing my branch. Excellent communication, and often presented very interesting and applicable ideas.     
    Her idea to use notion to help us organize our project was a brilliant idea which has helped us stay focused and on 
    task. - Patrick

    Saju has been a very valued member of the team since the beginning of this course, she has always gone above and
    beyond to make sure things get done and we stay organized. I can always count on her to clarify something I am
    confused about and have never once worried about her not getting done what she says she will do. While I understand
    constructive criticism is important, I do not have any at all for Saju. I look forward to continuing to work
    together for the duration of this project. - Hailey

    Saju has been crucial in sprint 1 in organizing and assigning tasks and remains so in sprint 2. Saju helped me
    every time I had issues and never judged anyone for making mistakes no matter their simplicity. I am glad to have
    Saju in my group and I believe she will be just as great and important in sprint 3. - Michael

    Saju's problem-solving skills were instrumental in programming the server requests. Her Organizational skills 
    ensured that all necessary tasks were assigned correctly and completed timely, contributing to the seamless 
    operation of our team. She also displayed exceptional teamwork skills by always being willing to help others 
    and share her knowledge, which enhanced the learning and experience of the gr oup as a whole. However, she could 
    endeavor to be more decisive and confident in making important decisions. -Jason

**Reviews for Hailey**

	Hailey has been incredibly hard working throughout the course of both the previous sprint and the upcoming deadline. 
    She has been excellent to work with in terms of the requirement of compatibility between the HTML and CSS and my    
    contributions with the server and UserClass. She is very dedicated to the project and is a very clear communicator 
    which is a large asset. - Patrick

    Hailey's contributions during code reviews have been invaluable in sprint 2, offering insightful suggestions that 
    enhance project quality. Her ability to identify and troubleshoot methodological issues 
    and bugs has been a critical in implementing new features. Does excellent job as a SCRUM master tracking progress 
    on the Kanban board, ensuring efficient workflow management. - Saju

    Hailey has been dedicated and hardworking right from the very beginning and remains so in sprint 2. She spends a lot
    of time working on the project, primarily on the front-end, and her HTML and CSS contributions are fantastic.
    Hailey was able to implement my functions from the back-end to the front-end almost flawlessly and I am glad that 
    that we can cooperate together well. - Michael

    Hailey has shown exceptional expertise in the front end. Her ability to understand complex HTML DOM’s and apply 
    them practically was greatly beneficial to the website. Never one to shy away from challenges, she often took 
    the lead on the most complex tasks, showing remarkable resilience and perseverance. Her active participation in 
    group meetings and insightful contributions greatly influenced the website’s direction. I recommend she works on 
    time-management to ensure all work is done within the set deadlines. -Jason

**Reviews for Michael**

	Micheal has been very present and is always available and willing to discuss details of the project.        
    Despite him working on the review class predominantly while I work on the UserClass, it has been very beneficial        
    to discuss our implementation details despite us working on separate portions of the system architecture.   
    Ideally, during the final sprint more integration of our separate modules would be excellent, 
    as it would be nice to work directly with everyone. - Patrick

    During the first sprint, I felt as if Michael could have worked on code aspects a little more than he did, I no
    longer see this as an issue at all. Michael pulled through in getting many of our features done very quickly, and I
    strongly believe we would not have the features we needed to get finished without him. If I had to critique
    Michael, I would suggest that he take more time to understand the rest of the code the group has created just to 
    make his life easier and to rely less on other group members to explain the code. This is a very minor complaint, as
    overall I am very happy with Michaels's effort this sprint and hope to see it continue for sprint 3. - Hailey

    Michael has shown remarkable improvement since Sprint 1, consistently completing his assigned tasks on time. 
    His methods are notably clean and efficient, and he promptly addresses feedback provided during code reviews. 
    For future development, I suggest Michael increase his involvement in the planning and design stages - Saju

    Michael has consistently shown a high level of commitment and dedication to our software engineering project. 
    His code contributions are always on time, reliable and show a great understanding of Python and Bottle. 
    He maintains open and clear communication which greatly assists in keeping everyone up-to-date on their progress. 
    Moving forward, it would be beneficial for him to take a more proactive role in group discussions. -Jason

**Reviews for Jason**

	Jason is an excellent communicator and is very proficient in HTML. 
    He and I worked well together when he used my implementation of the UserClass in combination with his HTML 
    for the login page and various other tasks. Despite him being sick during a portion of the second sprint, 
    he was always available to communicate with online to iron out any details. 
    I look forward to working further with Jason between his front-end work and my back-end work. - Patrick

    I felt that Jason was a little checked out during this sprint, while he does live out of town we did not
    see him in person much this sprint, and he was only assigned one task, and while he did try, it did not get 
    to a working point by the time the deadline came around. I believe that if Jason takes the initiative to work on 
    tasks when they are assigned and looks into what is expected for the project on his own he could make a real 
    contribution to the team, but as it stands I was disappointed with his lack of effort. I do look forward to 
    continuing working with Jason and hope to see a greater initiative in sprint 3. - Hailey

    Jason faced health challenges at the start of this sprint, which understandably impacted his task completion timeline. 
    With Hailey's assistance, he managed to complete his assignments. Jason also made contributions 
    to writing unit tests. For future sprints, I recommend that Jason proactively manage his tasks and seek assistance 
    when necessary to maintain steady progress. - Saju

    Jason was not very active in sprint 2, and my criticism of him from sprint 1 remains valid. Although he had 
    made some contributions in sprint 2, he needs to put in more effort, be present more often, and take the project
    more seriously. - Michael
    
**Reviews for Patrick:**

    Patrick made a clear effort during this sprint and got assigned tasks done very quickly, he asked questions when
    needed and communicated well. If I were to give any advice to Patrick it would be to take some time to learn the
    code in our project himself, as it would save time by not having group members help explain it, as well as helping 
    avoid errors that need to be fixed later. I was occasionally confused about how his code worked which took some time
    to explain from him, but I was very grateful that he was eager to clear up any confusion. Overall I have enjoyed 
    working with him, and hope to see him continue to be committed to the project. - Hailey

    Patrick has primarily focused on editing user tasks and improving the server. Although I felt there was an initial delay 
    in his contributions, he quickly regained momentum. Moving forward, I recommend that Patrick engage more  
    in planning and design tasks. - Saju

    Patrick was hardworking in sprint 2 and took his tasks seriously. He put in a good amount of effort and asked for 
    help whenever he ran into problems. However, there is a lack of communication between me and him, and I am kind of
    unsure of how his code works. - Michael

    Patrick has demonstrated excellent versatility, easily adapting to different  tasks as needed, which has greatly
    contributed to the website’s success. His positive attitude towards constructive feedback is very professional, 
    and he consistently uses it to improve his performance. Though his technical competency is very good, there were 
    occasions when code submissions were late, affecting project timelines. Improving time management skills would 
    greatly enhance his productivity. -Jason

## Sprint 1

Note from Patrick: Must address that it is difficult to criticize any group members with any genuine issues. 
                   Attempted to ensure legitimacy of reviews without being dishonest about my lack of conflict or disagreements because there were not any.
    
**Reviews for Saju**
    
    Very clear about explanations and communication in general. 
    Always present during group discussion and brought many applicable ideas to the discussion.
    Did excellent work thus far with the persistent storage for our user profiles and the review class. - Patrick

    Saju was a great help during this sprint, she always spent her free time making sure tasks got done and would help
    anyone who needed it. She never missed any meetings, and I never had to re-ask her to get something done. Overall I 
    could tell she cared about the project and was commited to pulling her weight. I look forward to continuing to work 
    with her. - Hailey
    
    Saju makes a good leader, she quickly set direction for the team from the start. She worked well under pressure 
    without compromising on the quality of the project. The  JSON files she wrote for the persistence storage were well
    done. A minor suggestion for her might be to take a moment to double-check her code before moving forward. This way, 
    she can catch any logical errors and reduce any boilerplate. - Jason

    Saju demonstrates an impressive depth of knowledge and consistently provides invaluable support in task organization
    and assignment. She is also ready to address any issues whenever prompted. - Michael

**Reviews for Hailey**
        
    Highly productive and very strong soft skills. Did excellent work with the UI aspects of the first Sprint of the 
    project. Very motivated and goal oriented, which assisted the group in terms the practical direction of the project.
    Incredibly knowledgeable about HTML and CSS, which was a large interdependency in our project. - Patrick
    
    Hailey was very energetic about doing work. She wrote a lot of the HTML and CSS. She was good at organizing the 
    team and delegating tasks. She kept the team in a state of cohesion rather than confusion or chaos. One thing I
    would recommend is for her to not worry about the application being too creative from the start and instead aim for 
    a bare-minimum working implementation in the beginning. - Jason

    Hailey is well organized. She kept the team on track and was mindful of deadlines. Apart from her assigned coding 
    tasks, Hailey also designed UI for our platform, and contributed in developing the front-end. CSS is her strength. 
    She spent a lot of time, beyond what's expected. Though sometimes it stresses her out, she always pushes for the 
    best! - Saju

    Hailey is always cheerful and helpful and works hard to keep everything in check and is also good at splitting 
    tasks evenly to everyone. She is also strict and assertive in a beneficial way. - Michael

**Reviews for Michael**

    Michael worked to get the tasks done that he was assigned, and would ask for help when he needed it to make sure 
    things ran smootly. He did not miss any meetings, and was always very pleasent and brought the morale up whenever we 
    were getting frusturated that an aspect of our project was not going as expected. Sometimes Michael missunderstood
    the expectations of his tasks, but always diligently worked to fix any issues. Michael is a valued member of 
    our group. - Hailey
    
    Michael was diligent and reliable. He displayed commitment and dedication to the project on all accounts. He works 
    incredibly fast and often finishes his tasks ahead of schedule. He had good time management skills and met all 
    deadlines. He brought a sense of calm to the team which contributed to the smooth running of the project. 
    His efficiency was extraordinary, although he should remember to keep the team updated on implementation details of 
    his code. - Jason
    
    Very diligent and responsive. Easy to reach to collaborate on any specific issues that may need to be addressed as 
    a group. Presented ideas which were very usefor for practical implementation of our project; a very pragmatic and 
    organized teammate. Helpful to discuss ideas one on one in terms of discovering new perspectives on the task at 
    hand. - Patrick

    Michael is very pleasant to work with. He actively participated in team meetings. He isn't hesitant to seek 
    clarification or assistance when necessary. If Michael can put in some extra hours and take more initiatives, he'll
    be one of the best on our team! - Saju

**Reviews for Jason**
    
    Worked well together with the collaboration between the initial log in page and my User class. 
    Always available to discuss issues and difficulties in the code base; communicates well and contributed to group 
    discussion greatly. Worked together one on one in our spare time and our working styles are very similar. - Patrick

    Jason is working with me on front-end aspects, and he was a large help in writing the sign in and log in pages
    which I really appreciated. While I believe Jason could take the initative to finish tasks on his own more often,
    he did help whenever I asked him to. Other group members got things done faster so I was occasionlly worried 
    tasks might not get done. I look forward to continue working with Jason - Hailey

    Jason has made significant contributions to front-end development. He brings valuable insights to the table, 
    particularly during technical discussions. Jason has a positive attitude and is always ready to help other members. 
    By focusing more on assigned tasks and timelines, he'll become a valuable asset to the team! - Saju

    Jason is friendly and maintains a satisfactory level of performance. He has possesses great knowledge about 
    web development. However, he can do better. Due to living far away from campus, he could not attend some of our
    meetings and can sometimes be lazy and uninterested. - Michael

**Reviews for Patrick**

    Patrick was very helpful in getting our server up and running and got the tasks done that were assigned to him. 
    He was very pleasent to work with and did not miss any meetings. I was appreciative that he took initiative to be 
    the note taker and SCRUM master respectivly. Occasionally I was unsure what Patricks code did, but he had no issues
    with expaninding doc strings or answering questions I had. My only suggestion for him could be to discuss what he is
    working on more. Patrick is a good addition to the team. - Hailey
    
    Patrick produced the most creative ideas while the team was brainstorming.  His attention to detail and keen 
    problem-solving ability were key to implementing the user class and engineering its tricky methods. However, 
    sometimes his ideas can be a bit too complex. It might be more constructive if he broke down his ideas into simpler
    terms so everybody could understand and contribute. - Jason

    Patrick is very diligent. First to complete his assigned tasks. Always gives his valuable insights during decision making. 
    Has a collaborative approach. Patrick has significantly contributed to server development . With increased initiative, 
    he has the potential to excel as a scrum master! - Saju 

    Patrick is hard-working, he takes his work seriously and does everything he is assigned to do, he does not get 
    distracted and is friendly and cooperative. However, we missed him on our final meeting on the 20th. Overall,
    he is still a valuable member of the team. - Michael
